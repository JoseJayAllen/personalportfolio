                    <h2>Education</h2> 
                    <p>During my time at Buyagan Elementary School, I valued building meaningful connections with classmates, forming lasting friendships, and learning the importance of empathy, communication, and mutual respect. These experiences shaped my social and emotional growth, helping me appreciate the diversity of individuals around me.<br><br>

                    High school was a chapter filled with laughter, camaraderie, and unforgettable moments. From performing celebrity impersonations at a talent show to embracing unexpected humor during a muddy hike, I always sought to bring joy to those around me. My knack for turning mishaps into fun and executing memorable pranks, like filling the staff room with balloons on April Fool's Day, highlighted my ability to foster a sense of community and shared happiness.<br><br>
                        
                    Now, as a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology student at the University of the Cordilleras, I am focused on honing my technical expertise. My education encompasses software development, database management, networking, and cybersecurity, preparing me to tackle complex challenges in the IT industry. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I’ve gained both knowledge and a mindset of continuous learning and innovation.<br><br>
                        
                    From meaningful connections in elementary school to memorable adventures in high school, and now, my dedication to IT in college, each stage of my journey has shaped me into a compassionate, innovative, and driven individual.</p>
